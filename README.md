<h2>Objective</h2>

Horiseon is a marketing agency who wants their website's codebase to be refactored so that it follows accesibility standards and is optimized for search engines.

The languages used in this project are HTML and CSS.

Some of the changes made were implementing proper HTML semantics, adding alt attributes to all images, and condensing some of the CSS to streamline the code.
